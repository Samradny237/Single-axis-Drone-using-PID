# Single-axis-Drone-using-PID
Controlling BLDC Motor using PID for Single Axis Drone
A mini-project focused on implementing PID control to stabilize and control a Brushless DC (BLDC) motor in a single-axis drone using Arduino and MPU6050.

📝 Project Description
This project aims to enhance stability and maneuverability of a single-axis drone by controlling its BLDC motor with a PID controller. It integrates sensor feedback from an MPU6050 gyroscope to dynamically adjust motor speed, improving performance in real-time.

🎯 Objectives
Understand PID control and its role in drone stability.

Interface BLDC motors with ESC and Arduino.

Integrate MPU6050 sensor for feedback.

Assemble and test the drone model.

Ensure smooth and stable control of drone movement.
